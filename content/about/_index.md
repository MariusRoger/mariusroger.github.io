I just finished my studies in computer science at the [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/ "ENS Paris Saclay website"), and the [IASD](https://www.masteriasd.eu/ "IASD website") Master's degree at [Dauphine PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/ "Dauphine PSL website").

I am currently looking for a job around machine learning, in R&D, ML Ops, or Data science.
